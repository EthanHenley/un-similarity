Temporary README for UN vote similarity visualization project.

Data collected by Voeten et al [here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LEJUQZ). They describe it as follows: "This is a dataset of roll-call votes in the UN General Assembly 1946-2018."

Original dataset will not be hosted on GitHub; code for downloading it will be added to workbook along with repeated citation.
